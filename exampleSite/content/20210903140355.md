There is a feature to handle pending tasks, that is a task manager. You can activate this feature in the configuration file under `todofeat: true`. This feature is intended to works like a GTD tool. The approach is to join pending taks and documentation in the same place.

You can define notes with layout `todo` for tasks. There are some tasks as an example on `exampleContent`. You can create inmediate tasks which don't need to create a specific note, like:
- [ ] Buy bread
- [x] Cook the food
- [ ] Clean my bedroom

The notes with layout `todo` will be listed using some parameters, like in taskwarrior, at the end of the note. The urgency of each note is calculated like in task warrior, the coefficient are explained in [the documentation of task warrrior](https://taskwarrior.org/docs/urgency.html). Each note with layout `todo` can define optional arguments that are used for calculating the urgency of each task, and presented to the used in descendent order. The different parameters defined in the front-matter are:

```
layout: todo
priority: 1 # Optional argument. 1 to 3, 3 is max priority, 1 is minimum
deadline: 2021-09-20T13:00:00 # Optional argument. 
                              # Written in YYYY-MM-DD or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
status: 2 # Optional argument. The different status are:
          # 1. Pending task
          # 2. Started task
          # 3. Finished task
          # 4. Waiting task
          # 5. Blocked task
```
